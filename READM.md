This is a video series on WP Plugin Boilerplate - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsszRSbzjyvn-RQr4dEjrgnTne2HcJKee

It has a fully scaffolded out plugin using REST APIs, wp_nonce, REACT, VUE, JS as well as how to redirect pages to plugin template files.

There is a MySQL CRUD application in the ADMIN section.

The repo contains notes as well as the slides used in the video.

Thanks to Devin Vinson for maintaining this great resource.

The slides have links to some courses (free and paid) that go into more detailed examples of using this Boilerplate and I hope this scaffolded version and videos seroes help you get started.
